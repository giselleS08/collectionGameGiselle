My project, Collection game, a game where the player uses the right and left arrow keys to move the platform and prevent the ball from touching the bottom of the screen.

I made this project during the GirlsWhoCode curriculum to learn how to move sprites across the screen.
 
I made this project using code from the p5play library using kb.pressing() to make it to where the player can interact with the platform.

I struggled with the kb.pressing() not working how I wanted it to move. I learned that I had to have 3 conditions for it (one to move left, one to move right, and one to stay still).
